/**
 *
 * Problem:
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat
 * numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the
 * array. The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and
 * since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called
 * Dutch National Flag problem.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
 * Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
 * Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2]
 *
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 *
 * @param {number[]} colorArray
 * @return {number[]}
