     * pointer always moves first:
     *  1. If the fast pointer is one step behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer
     * moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step, and they both meet.
     *  2. If the fast pointer is two steps behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer
     * moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step. After the moves, the fast
     * pointer will be one step behind the slow pointer, which reduces this scenario
     * to the first scenario. This means that the two pointers will meet in the next
     * iteration.
