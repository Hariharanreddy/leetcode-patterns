/**
 *
 * Problem:
 * Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that
 * returns the maximum sum. A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any
 * two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass through the root. The path must contain at
 * least one node.
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1, 2, 3, null, 4, 5, 6]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: The path with maximum sum is: [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 6, null, null, null, null, 7, 8, 9]
 * Output: 31
 * Explanation:  The path with maximum sum is: [8, 5, 3, 6, 9]
 *
 *
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(h)
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
