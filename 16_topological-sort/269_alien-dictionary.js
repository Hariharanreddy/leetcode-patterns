/**
 *
 * Problem:
 * There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know
 * the ordering of the alphabets. Write a method to find the correct order of the
 * alphabets in the alien language. It is given that the input is a valid dictionary and
 * there exists an ordering among its alphabets.
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/ (subscription)
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
 * Output: bac
 * Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the
 * alien language, so from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among
 * its characters:
 *  1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
 *  2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
 * From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
 * Output: ywxz
 * Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its
 * characters:
 *  1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
 *  2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
 *  3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
 *  4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
 *  5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'
 * From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
